      When writing image generation prompts:

      1. Visual Elements:
         - Use concrete, observable physical descriptions
         - Focus on body position, posture, and visible actions
         - Include clear facial expressions and movements
         - Specify physical characteristics that can be depicted

      2. Structure:
         - Start with the subject ("person")
         - Follow with primary physical descriptors
         - State the action clearly
         - Add supporting visual details
         - Keep descriptions parallel and consistent

      3. Language:
         - Avoid narrative or story-telling language
         - Don't use temporal words (before, after, while, during)
         - Don't use emotional or mental state words
         - Don't include character motivations or backstory
         - Use present tense, active voice

      4. Format:
         - Keep prompts concise and focused
         - Use commas to separate descriptors
         - Maintain consistent descriptor ordering
         - Group related visual elements together

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Narrative/Emotional Language
      "person feeling tired while trying to play volleyball, hoping to improve"
      
      # Good: Visual Description
      "person with slouched posture playing volleyball, bent back, heavy breathing, red face"

      # Bad: Abstract/Mental States
      "person thinking about giving up, mentally exhausted from exercise"
      
      # Good: Observable States
      "person with drooping shoulders, head down, slow steps, sweating, unsteady movement"
